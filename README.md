## Discription
The Total Town Car Service's website is a comprehensive online platform for a local taxi service company in Minneapolis, MN. The project aims to provide a digital storefront for the company, presenting a highly interactive user interface for clients to explore services, make bookings, and leave feedback.

A significant challenge encountered during the project was implementing a feature to send out emails to clients without a backend infrastructure, due to the client's budget constraints. However, with extensive research and the application of innovative problem-solving techniques, I was able to overcome this hurdle by integrating third-party email services that didn't require a dedicated backend.

Despite this and many more challenges, the project was a rewarding endeavor, offering many opportunities to apply and expand technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and creativity.

The website comprises three main components:

1. Home Page: This page introduces the company and its services to prospective clients. It shares a brief history of Total Town Car Service, its services, and why they are a trusted choice for transportation needs in the Minneapolis area.

2. Booking Page: This interactive feature allows clients to book taxi services online conveniently. Clients can choose their preferred date, and time, and specify their pick-up and drop-off locations. The booking interface is user-friendly, making the reservation process smooth and straightforward.

3. Review Page: The review page provides a platform for clients to share their experiences and rate the services they received. These testimonials are invaluable for building trust with potential clients and for the business to continuously improve its service offerings.
